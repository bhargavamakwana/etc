# Random Shell Scripts

This repo contains random shell scripts for ease in daily but extremely time saving use cases.
The name of the scripts should be apparent enough to give a gist of what the script does. If in case you need more clarity, please go to the shell script code description inside the script.
Also, feel free to give your comments and create any issues or improvements or modifications if needed.
